## API Hackathon
### Create a RESTful API with a dataset of your chosing! 
* You can use one of the sample datasets I've provided, or hunt down one of your own using some of the links below. 
* Don't spend too much time gathering data! If you do decide to find your own dataset, Iâ€™d recommend starting by modeling a few items in JSON, using Postman or curl-ing a small sample of data, putting it in a JSON file or a simple mongo DB, and then building the URL endpoints and controllers to perform and serve up queries for the data.
* Bonus points if you can deploy the API server and data to Heroku, Azure, or another PaaS of your choosing! 

### Places to find data sets
#### I've included sample data sets for sales contacts, Game of Thrones characters, and the original 151 Pokemon, though feel free to find your own!
* https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets - An (awesome) list of JSON datasets that require no authentication
* https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis - A list of public API's to grab data from.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets - A small-ish subreddit devoted to free datasets (sorting by top/all time usually yields the best results)
